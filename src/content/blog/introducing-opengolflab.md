Golf simulators have quietly become the most data-rich way to practice. Every swing produces a dozen precise numbers — ball speed, launch angle, spin, carry, side, descent — and yet most of that data evaporates the moment you close the software. You hit a great 7-iron, the number flashes on screen, and then it's gone.

**OpenGolfLab exists to fix that.** We're building open, community-driven analytics for simulator golf, and we're starting where it matters most: your own shots.

## First, make your data useful

Our first product, [Golf Sim Analytics](/download), is a free Windows app for [GSPro](https://gsprogolf.com/) users. It captures everything GSPro already produces — automatically — and turns it into 15 interactive dashboards covering dispersion, gapping, trajectory, swing efficiency, speed training, on-course scoring, and live sessions.

There are no import buttons. Practice Range exports are picked up from your Desktop the instant they appear, and live rounds are tracked in real time and archived when you finish. You play; the analytics fill in.

Just as important: it's **local-first**. Your data lives in Parquet files right next to the app. Nothing is uploaded, there's no account, and there's no server that could leak it. Free, private, yours.

## Then, make everyone's data useful

Here's the part we're most excited about. When thousands of sim golfers each have their own numbers, something bigger becomes possible: a shared, anonymized picture of how the game actually plays on a simulator.

That's [the Lab](/lab) — an open framework where players can opt in to contribute stripped-down ball and club metrics, producing analytics no individual could generate alone:

- **Real-world ball comparisons** built from community data, not marketing sheets.
- **Gapping distributions by handicap** — what a 12 actually carries a 7-iron, across thousands of shots.
- **Launch and spin norms** you can trust, so the app can flag your shots against the community, not just Tour ideals.

The Lab is opt-in, anonymized, and being built in the open. It's early — a credible "coming soon" rather than a live dataset — but the app is laying the groundwork now.

## Why "open"

Sim golf tools tend to be closed: your data goes in, insights come out, and you never really own either. We think the opposite approach is more useful and more trustworthy. Keep the raw data on the player's machine. Make the aggregate analytics a shared community resource. Build it where people can see it.

If that resonates, the best way to help right now is simple: [download the app](/download), play a few sessions, and [watch the repo on GitHub](/lab). We'll post every meaningful update right here.

Every shot. Every insight. Let's build it together.
